## Database Schema

### Tables

#### `events`
- Main event information
- Global settings for time/location
- Date-specific options storage

#### `event_dates`
- Individual dates for each event
- Date-specific location and time overrides
- Links to main event

#### `event_rsvps`
- RSVP responses from participants
- JSON storage for date-specific responses
- Comment and metadata

### Key Fields

```sql
-- Events table
id: UUID (Primary Key)
user_id: UUID (Creator)
title: TEXT
description: TEXT
location: TEXT
start_time: TIMESTAMPTZ
end_time: TIMESTAMPTZ
use_same_location: BOOLEAN
use_same_time: BOOLEAN
date_specific_options: JSONB

-- Event dates table
id: UUID (Primary Key)
event_id: UUID (Foreign Key)
date: DATE
location: TEXT
start_time: TIMESTAMPTZ
end_time: TIMESTAMPTZ

-- RSVPs table
id: UUID (Primary Key)
event_id: UUID (Foreign Key)
voter_name: TEXT
responses: JSONB ({"date_id": "yes|no|maybe"})
comment: TEXT
```

## User Flow

### 1. **Event Creation**
```
Create Event Button â†’ Calendar Selection â†’ Date Review â†’ Event Created
```

1. User clicks "Create Event" button
2. Enters event name and description
3. Selects available dates from calendar
4. Reviews dates and sets time/location options
5. Finalizes event creation
6. Redirected to new event page

### 2. **Event Participation**
```
Event Link â†’ View Event â†’ RSVP â†’ Submit Response
```

1. Participant receives event link
2. Views event details and available dates
3. Enters name and selects responses for each date
4. Submits RSVP
5. Can update responses later

### 3. **Event Management**
```
Event List â†’ Event Actions â†’ Edit/Delete/Share
```

1. Creator views their events
2. Can edit event details
3. Delete events (with confirmation)
4. Share event links
5. View RSVP results

## Integration Points

### **DateReviewModal**
- **Purpose**: Final step in event creation
- **Features**: Time/location setup, toggle controls, date-specific options
- **Integration**: Receives selected dates, returns final event options

### **ScrollableTimePicker**
- **Purpose**: Time selection for events
- **Features**: Scrollable time wheel, manual input, validation
- **Integration**: Used in DateReviewModal for time selection

### **EventCard**
- **Purpose**: Display events in lists
- **Features**: Event summary, action buttons, responsive design
- **Integration**: Used in events list screen

## API Endpoints

### **Supabase Tables**
- `events` - Event CRUD operations
- `event_dates` - Date management
- `event_rsvps` - RSVP handling

### **Real-time Features**
- **RSVP subscriptions** for live updates
- **Event changes** notifications
- **Participant updates** in real-time

## Styling & Design

### **Consistent with App**
- **Poppins font family** throughout
- **Color scheme** matching existing components
- **Component patterns** following established conventions
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes

### **Visual Elements**
- **Calendar interface** for date selection
- **Progress bars** for RSVP visualization
- **Icon system** for actions and status
- **Card-based layout** for content organization

## Security & Permissions

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- **Events**: Users can only modify their own events
- **Dates**: Only event creators can modify dates
- **RSVPs**: Anyone can create, users can update their own

### **Data Validation**
- **Time validation**: End time must be after start time
- **Date validation**: Cannot select past dates
- **Required fields**: Event name and at least one date

## Future Enhancements

### **Potential Features**
- **Event templates** for recurring events
- **Advanced scheduling** with time zones
- **Notification system** for event reminders
- **Calendar integration** with external services
- **Event categories** and filtering
- **Participant limits** and waitlists

### **Technical Improvements**
- **Caching strategy** for better performance
- **Offline support** for mobile apps
- **Analytics dashboard** for event insights
- **API rate limiting** for scalability

## Usage Examples

### **Creating a Simple Event**
```typescript
// User selects dates and sets global time/location
const eventOptions = {
  location: "Game Night HQ",
  startTime: new Date("2024-01-15T18:00:00"),
  endTime: new Date("2024-01-15T22:00:00"),
  useSameLocation: true,
  useSameTime: true
};
```

### **Creating a Complex Event**
```typescript
// User sets different times/locations per date
const eventOptions = {
  location: "Main Location",
  startTime: new Date("2024-01-15T18:00:00"),
  endTime: new Date("2024-01-15T22:00:00"),
  useSameLocation: false,
  useSameTime: false,
  dateSpecificOptions: {
    "2024-01-15": {
      location: "Location A",
      startTime: new Date("2024-01-15T18:00:00"),
      endTime: new Date("2024-01-15T22:00:00")
    },
    "2024-01-22": {
      location: "Location B",
      startTime: new Date("2024-01-22T19:00:00"),
      endTime: new Date("2024-01-22T23:00:00")
    }
  }
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **Event not saving**: Check database permissions and RLS policies
2. **Time picker not working**: Verify ScrollableTimePicker component integration
3. **RSVPs not updating**: Check Supabase subscription setup
4. **Date selection issues**: Verify calendar component state management

### **Debug Steps**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection and authentication
3. Test database queries directly
4. Check component prop passing
5. Verify state management flow

## Conclusion

The Event System provides a robust, scalable solution for event management that integrates seamlessly with the existing application architecture. It follows established patterns, maintains consistent styling, and provides a smooth user experience from creation to participation.

The system is designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements while maintaining the current functionality and performance standards.
