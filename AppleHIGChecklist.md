# Apple Human Interface Guidelines Checklist for GameNyte

## üéØ Core Design Principles

### Clarity
- [ ] **Primary content visible** without zooming or horizontal scrolling
- [ ] **Clear visual hierarchy** - most important content is prominently displayed
- [ ] **Readable text** at all sizes with appropriate contrast
- [ ] **Intuitive icons** that clearly represent their function
- [ ] **Simple, focused interface** - avoid clutter and unnecessary elements

### Deference
- [ ] **Content is king** - UI should support content, not compete with it
- [ ] **Subtle animations** that enhance rather than distract
- [ ] **Minimal chrome** - reduce non-essential UI elements
- [ ] **Let content fill the screen** appropriately

### Depth
- [ ] **Visual layers** create hierarchy and understanding
- [ ] **Appropriate use of blur and transparency** for depth
- [ ] **Consistent elevation** for modal presentations and overlays

## üì± Layout & Visual Design

### Screen Adaptation
- [ ] **Safe Area compliance** - content respects notches, home indicator, status bar
- [ ] **Multiple screen sizes** - iPhone SE to iPhone 14 Pro Max compatibility
- [ ] **Portrait and landscape** orientation support where appropriate
- [ ] **Proper margins** - minimum 16pt from screen edges
- [ ] **Flexible layouts** that adapt to different screen sizes

### Typography
- [ ] **Dynamic Type support** - text scales with user's preferred size
- [ ] **Proper font hierarchy** - clear distinction between headlines, body, captions
- [ ] **High contrast text** - minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- [ ] **Readable line lengths** - avoid overly long or short lines
- [ ] **Consistent font usage** throughout the app

### Color & Contrast
- [ ] **Semantic color usage** - red for destructive, blue for informational, etc.
- [ ] **Dark mode compatibility** - proper color schemes for both light and dark modes
- [ ] **Accessibility contrast** - meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] **Color is not the only indicator** - use icons, text, or shapes as backup
- [ ] **Brand colors work in all contexts** (light/dark, accessibility modes)

## üß≠ Navigation & Structure
