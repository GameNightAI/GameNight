/* This view expands on the `collections_games` view by adding
the `min_exp_players` and `max_exp_players` columns. These are
intended for determining the "expanded" player counts from game expansions,
such as a max player count of 6 for Catan when the 5-6 player expansion is owned:

* `min_exp_players`: The minimum value of `min_players` out of
  all of a user's owned expansions for a particular game

* `max_exp_players`: The maximum value of `max_players` out of
  all of a user's owned expansions for a particular game

If the user does not own any expansions for a particular game,
these columns will be NULL. */
