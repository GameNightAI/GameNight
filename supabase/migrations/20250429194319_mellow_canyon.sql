/*
  # Create collections schema

  1. New Tables
    - `collections`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `user_id` (uuid, references auth.users)
      - `bgg_game_id` (integer)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `name` (text)
      - `thumbnail` (text)
      - `min_players` (integer)
      - `max_players` (integer)
      - `playing_time` (integer)
      - `year_published` (integer)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `collections` table
    - Add policies for authenticated users to:
      - Read their own collections
      - Insert new games
      - Delete their own games
